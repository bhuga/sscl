        <h2>What is it?</h2>

        <p>
          <strong>Tuesday Hack Night</strong>
          is New Orleans' premier weekly gathering for programmers, designers,
          hardware hackers, and other technically minded folks.  It's an
          aggressively unstructured way to hack amongst peers, converse about
          the vagaries of this or that methodology of developmental arts, or
          simply to partake of delicious libations in delightful company.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There's no agenda, no presentations, no requirements, and hackers and
          the hacker-curious of all levels are welcome to attend.
          <br/>
        </p>


        <h2>When and Where?</h2>

        <p>
          Our soir√©e happens
          <strong> every week, on Tuesday, at 7pm! </strong>
          We're generously sponsored by
          <strong>LaunchPad,</strong>
          a fine co-working space located at 
          643 Magazine St. Access to the gathering is via the 
          <strong>side entrance on Capdeville Street.</strong>
          To gain entry, you must enter the secret knock, which is any knock on
          the big glass window to the left the bar.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You'll also find a number of us either inside or outside of
          <strong>Capdeville,</strong>
          a purveyor of fine libations located just next door.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          There are occasional
          <strong>special events</strong>
          and
          <strong>sponsored hack nights.</strong>
          If you'd like to ensure your punctual notification of such occasions,
          please join
          <a href='http://www.meetup.com/nolahacknight/'>the meetup</a> or
          register for <a href='http://twitter.com/nolahacknight/'>carrier pigeon message service</a>
          so that we might send you telegrams.
        </p>

        <h2>It's my first time! What can I expect?</h2>

        <p>
          Naught but merriment, hacking, and chatter from 20-40 of your
          favorite kind of people, milling about between some handy desks, a
          comfortable sofa, and the libation-purveying establishment next door.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          You should feel welcome to come, sit down, and
          <strong>hack quietly amongst peers,</strong>
          or just as welcome to come, sit down, and
          <strong>argue about type systems.</strong>
          <br/>
          <br/>
          Some of our most frequent members had a great experience when they
          first arrived with
          <strong>a question to ask:</strong>
          "What kind of database should I use for this project?", or "Why should I care about type
          systems?", or "I hear about this Ruby on Rails thing: how's it better
          than PHP?" These questions, and many more, can be answered for you by
          many of our attendees, often vigorously.
          <br/>
          <br/>
          If you're shy, one of our fine greeters will be happy to introduce
          you to like-minded wizards of analytical enginery, or non-like
          minded, for the more pugnacious of you. Just walk up to one of these
          fine fellows and be greeted, and
          <strong>
            your first libation is on us!
          </strong>
